## üí° Learning Goals and Objectives
The goal for this project is to create a React app within about 8 hours in order to 'mock' an interview technical challenge. We had to include a way to manipulate the data being displayed, and had to implement Router to have a unique url when an article was clicked. 

## üèÜ Wins & Challenges: 
- The biggest challenge was not being sure about how I wanted the application to look. In hindsight, it would have been helpful to create a wireframe like I do on bigger projects. 

- A win was how quickly the app came together. I felt confident in my ability to add the functionality I wanted to add. 

## To see the app in Action: 

1. Clone down [this](https://github.com/Jwensloff/news-room) repository. 
2. Run the command `npm install` in your terminal. 
3. Run the command `npm start` in your terminal.
4. Browse the news and enjoy!
